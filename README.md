This mini Python project focuses on pure logic
the calculation here is not mere random
numbers, rather summation of the provided
names. e.g.

Assuming there's a Romeo named John and
a Juliet named Justina, then:

the names would be combined and the 
occurance of every letter would be counted.

[j,o,h,n,j,u,s,t,i,n,a]

[2,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1]

[2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

[3,3,2,2,1]

[4,5,2]

[6,5]

thus, the Love percentage between John
and Justina is 65%
